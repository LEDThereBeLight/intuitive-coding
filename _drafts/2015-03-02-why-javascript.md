In programming, every language uses the same ideas, but has different ways of solving problems. It's important to be comfortable with several different languages, because different problems are easier to solve using different methods. The more languages you know, the more ways you can think about how to solve a particular problem.

We're going to switch from Elm to the Javascript language. Javascript is much more flexible than Elm, because it lets you change things once you make them. This means we'll need to think harder about our code, because the mental model we've been using, where we substitute words for their definitions, no longer applies. Variables are really *variable*, and they can mean different things at different times.

But while Javascript is more difficult than Elm, it has a lot of advantages that make it a fantastic language to learn. It has [the largest](https://www.npmjs.com/) module ecosystem of *any language* built up around it, so we can take advantage of more code that other people have written to do complicated things without having to write everything ourselves. Javascript is also able to support a variety of coding patterns - so we can learn to solve problems in different ways without having to switch languages.

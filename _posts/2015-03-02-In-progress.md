### Where to go from here

What are you interested in?

Web programming:

  * Continue with Elm's [official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)
  * Try an Elm [unofficial tutorial](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/)
  * [Learn Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
  * Learn [Facebook's React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

Coding for interviews:

  * Learn [computer science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)
  * Learn [data structures and algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)
  * Do [practice problems](http://codewars.com/)

Artificial Intelligence:

  * Learn [the basics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/lecture-videos/)
  * Implement the algorithms
  * Practice [with a game](http://www.screeps.com)


### Plans for the future:

Switching languages (to either Typescript or Python) and continuing with coding:

  * data structures (linked lists, queues, arrays)
  * basic algorithms
    * sorting, hashing, searching
  * object oriented programming
  * state machines
  * modeling problems with graphs - choice and decision making, not "graph theory"

The idea is to work through interview questions in each section with a guide on how to think about solving the problems.

Later:

* artificial intelligence
	* goal trees
	* rule based systems
	* game theory and searching
	* constraints
	* visual recognition
	* neural nets
	* machine learning

### What did we just do?

So how are things getting shown on the screen just from writing a single line of code? To understand what's going on in our program, we first have to understand a few ideas about languages.

### Expressions

Have a look at this sentence.

A girl walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a double entendre, so he gave it to her.
{: .quote}

Some words are grouped together to create one meaning. The words "double" and "entendre" have individual meanings on their own, but when they're put together they mean something completely different. In this sentence, they just go together. The words "A girl" go together too. Neither would really make sense in the sentence without the other.

Other words have meanings all by themselves - they don't really go with any other word.

We call each grouping of words that creates a meaning an **expression**.

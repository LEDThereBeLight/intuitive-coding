### Styling our page

We've got a webpage, but it's not winning any user experience awards. Let's style it with some CSS, which is a simple language created to make web pages look nice.

If you have never seen CSS before, I recommend skimming the CSS section of [marksheet.io](http://marksheet.io/css-basics.html) to get a feel for it.

In a real application, we'd probably style our page using a CSS module. These modules aren't included with Elm by default, so we can't use them in the online editor. But HTML allows CSS styling through the `style` attribute, so we can just use that instead.

Here's our code so far:
{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    input [] [],
    br [] [],
    br [] [],
    button [] [Html.text "more!"],
    br [] [],
    br [] [],
    img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

### Centering our content

Let's put our content in the center of the page using `Html.Attributes.style`.

First, a few definitions. Let's look at some raw CSS code.

{% highlight css %}
div {
  text-align: center;
}
{% endhighlight %}

* div is a **selector**, saying which type of element we're styling
* the text inside the `{ }` is called a **declaration**
* the `text-align` part is call the **property**
* the `center` part is called the **value**

Don't bother memorizing these words, they're just listed here so we can talk about how they are used in Elm.

The style function takes one input, a list of CSS declarations






Add some `br [] []` lines to create new lines between our elements.

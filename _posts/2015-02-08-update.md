### The update

So now we've split our program into a model and a view. But it's still *static*! It seems like we did a lot of work for nothing, but that's just because we're missing the third and final piece of the puzzle: the **update**.

The update is where the magic happens. It's where we describe what to do depending on what changes in our program.

We need to make an update function. Let's ask ourselves the same questions we ask every time we make a new function:
  1. What should the function give back when it's done running?
  2. What information does the function need to do its job?

What will `update` give back when it's done running?
{: .info}
We always keep the current state of the program in the model, so it makes sense to have `update` give back a new model when it's done running.

What does `update` need in order to give us back a new model?
{: .info}
It needs to know *what changed*, and it needs the *current model* so that it can change it. That means `update` will have two inputs.

Let's write the skeleton of the function and then figure out the details after. We need a single word for each input, so we'll call what changes the "message" and the model the "model".

{% highlight elm %}
update message model =
  -- TODO: react to changes and give back a new updated model

{% endhighlight %}

A message can be any type, but it seems natural to use a String of words - like a real message.

Now we need to think about what messages `update` might receive that it has to react to. Our app has three buttons. We could use a generic message like "button clicked", but it wouldn't be specific enough to tell us which button was pressed and which type of picture should be shown. Instead, we'll have three different messages that represent each button being clicked:
  * "asked for cats"
  * "asked for dogs"
  * "asked for ice cream"

We will only ever receive one message at a time. So we need a way to make the update function do different things depending on which of the three messages it receives.

There are several ways to accomplish this. One way is to use an `if` expression, which is a way of providing control over which way a program runs.

Here's what we want to do in English. We'll translate it into Elm in a second.


  If the message is "asked for cats", give back a new model where the title is "cats" and the image location is a cat picture. Otherwise, skip this line and ask the next question.
{: .info}

  If the message is "asked for dogs", give back a new model where the title is "dogs" and the image location is a dog picture. Otherwise, skip this line and ask the next question.
{: .info}

  If the message is "asked for ice cream", give back a new model where the title is "ice cream" and the image location is an ice cream picture. Otherwise, we must have gotten a message that we don't know what to do with, so just give back the old model.
{: .info}

You'll notice every statement above follows a pattern. There are always three parts:
  1. a **conditional expression**, or just a **conditional**, after "if" which represents a *yes / no question*, like

  Was the message "asked for dogs"?
  {: .info}
  2. an expression to run if the answer is *yes*, like

  Give back a new model where the title is "dogs" and the image location is a dog picture
  {: .info}
  3. an expression to run if the answer is *no*, like

  Skip this line and check if any o patterns here
  {: .info}

Every `if` statement follows this pattern, which makes it easy to program. Here's what the template for an "if" statement looks like:

{% highlight elm %}
if {-conditional-} then {-run this expression-} else {-run this expression instead-}
{% endhighlight %}

The expressions after "then" and "else" can be *any* expression, like the ones we've been writing. But conditionals are a special kind of expression that we haven't learned yet. Conditionals are just *yes / no questions*. We ask a question, and if the answer is "yes", the computer runs the `then` expression and the `else` expression is completely skipped. If the answer to the question is "no", it runs the `else` expression instead.

That means that a conditional can only ever result in one of two values: *yes* or *no*. Or, in programming-speak, a conditional gives back a **boolean**.

### Booleans

A **boolean** is a word for a variable that can have one of two values. In English, "yes" and "no" are booleans. So are "true" and "false", "a" and "b", "1" and "0", and so on. It doesn't really matter what words we call the two choices, the point is that booleans only have two options which can't both be true at the same time.

In Elm, there's a type for booleans called `Bool`. A value that's a Bool type can have only be one of two things:
  1. `True`
  2. `False`

They are both capitalized because they're actually types, not just normal values. We'll answer why when we talk about Union Types later on, but for now we just need to know that when we want to use the True or False booleans in our code, we need to capitalize them.

### Comparison Operators

So how do we make a conditional expression that outputs a boolean? There are several functions built into Elm called **comparison** functions which take two inputs, compares them, and outputs a boolean.

Here are a few of our options for comparison functions:
  1. `>`, which is read as "greater than"
  2. `<`, which is read as "less than"
  3. `==`, which is read as "the same as"
  4. `/=`, which is read as "not the same as"

These functions are a little different from the ones we've seen so far. With most functions, we put all the inputs *after* the function name when we call them.

{% highlight elm %}
add 1 2 -- equal to 3
{% endhighlight %}

With comparison functions, we put the function *in between* the inputs. This makes things look a little more natural when we read them in our code.

{% highlight elm %}
2.5 > 10         -- False
1 < 2            -- True
'a' < 'b'        -- True
1 == 2           -- False
"Hello" /= "Hey" -- True
{% endhighlight %}

### An example `if` expression

`if` expressions are extremely important to understand, so let's walk through an example. I usually hate contrived examples, but we'll use one here to keep things simple.

Imagine we're writing a function that outputs one of two sentences depending on whether the color of the sky is blue or not. This is a perfect place for an `if` expression because we can make this into a yes/no question. We can ask "Is the sky blue?"

If the answer is yes, we want to give back the sentence "It's daytime!"

If the answer is no, we want to give back the sentence "Maybe it's nighttime?"

So we have the three things we need for the `if` expression:
  1. a yes / no question: "Is the sky blue?"
  2. an expression for if the answer is yes: "It's daytime!"
  3. an expression for if the answer is no: "Maybe it's nighttime?"

We need to write a function that checks whether the color of the sky is blue or not. We can't put spaces or question marks in function names, so we'll call it `theSkyIsBlue`.

Fortunately, this is a completely contrived example that I'm making up as we go, so let's say we have a Sky module we can import which has a function `color` that gives the current color of the sky.

We could write `theSkyIsBlue` like this:

{% highlight elm %}
theSkyIsBlue color = color == "blue"
{% endhighlight %}

This can be read as,

theSkyIsBlue is a function that takes a color and checks whether the color is the same as the String "blue"
{: .info}

This function definition will give back `True` or `False`, so we can use the function in an `if` expression. This isn't real Elm code here, so just read along and try to understand what's going on.

{% highlight elm %}
import Html
import Sky

theSkyIsBlue color = color == "blue"

main = if (theSkyIsBlue Sky.color)
       then Html.text "It's daytime!"
       else Html.text "Maybe it's nighttime?"
{% endhighlight %}

As with other expressions, spacing doesn't matter. So we could have written the `if` expression in one line.

Here's the flow of what's happening in the code.

![if-then-else](images/if-then-else-sky.png)

Remember, only *one* of the expressions will be evaluated. So if the conditional expression evaluates to True, the `else` condition won't do anything, even if it would do something *terrible* if it were to run.

### Adding conditional expressions to `update`

Enough examples - let's write the update function for our app.

Let's put our three messages in the `update` function. This code won't do anything yet, we're just adding them in for us to work with.

{% highlight elm %}
update message model =
  -- TODO: react to three messages:
  "asked for cats"
  "asked for dogs"
  "asked for ice cream"
{% endhighlight %}

When update is called with a specific message, we need to ask whether the message is the same as any of the three messages we created above and handle it appropriately. Here's how we'll do that.

{% highlight elm %}
update message model =
  if message == "asked for cats" then           -- TODO: handle the change
  else if message == "asked for dogs" then      -- TODO: handle the change
  else if message == "asked for ice cream" then -- TODO: handle the change
  else -- TODO: the message isn't something we recognize, so do nothing
{% endhighlight %}

Here's the flow diagram of what we're doing with this code. The computer reads the lines top down and only evaluates the `else` expressions if it has to.

![if-then-else-tree](images/if-then-else-tree.png)

Ok, now we just need to handle the changes and we should be done with the update function.

### Making Changes

Ok, here's what our model looks like again just so we know what we're working with.

model = ("cats", "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif")

In our `update` function, we're going to react to the message and give back a new model.

"Hey," you say. "We're taking in the old model as an input, so shouldn't we just change what's inside it and give it back? rather than making a whole new one?"

Nope.
{: .important}

One of the defining features that makes Elm so great is that you can never change data once it's been created. We're not going to *change* the existing model in the update function, we're going to make a brand new model.

Admittedly, not being able to change anything in our program sounds like a terrible design decision. But 50 years of programming research has proven otherwise. Most of the bugs that occur in programs happen from variables unexpectedly changing. It causes problems that are difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot. Take a look at Facebook's [Immutable JS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) for some more background on why not allowing data to change is a good thing and actually leads to faster code.

### Actually handling change in our `update`

Our model is pretty simple. It's just a Tuple of two Strings. So each of the `if` conditions in our code can give back a new Tuple with different Strings inside. We need one for cats, one for dogs, and one for ice cream. Here are some image locations you can use:

{% highlight elm %}
update message model =
       if message == "asked for cats" then ("cats", image)
  else if message == "asked for dogs" then ("dogs", image)
  else if message == "asked for ice cream" then ("ice cream", image)
  else model
{% endhighlight %}

In the last line, we're just giving back the old model if the message doesn't match one of our expected Strings.

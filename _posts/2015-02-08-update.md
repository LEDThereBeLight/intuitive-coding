### The update

So now we've split our program into a model and a view. But it's still *static*! It seems like we did a lot of work for nothing, but that's just because we're missing the third and final piece of the puzzle: the **update**.

The update is where the magic happens. It's where we describe what to do depending on what changes in our program. It's usually called a Controller, like in [Model View Controller](wikipedia or something), but Elm's take on things is a little different, so it's appropriate to name it something else.

There are many approaches for implementing an update function. Elm uses a **state machine**, which is another extremely important and useful topic in computer programming. We'll come back to state machines when we talk about Artificial Intelligence. State machines are simple "machines" in the form of a function that takes in the current state (the model), an event that occurs, and a description for how to change the model based on the event. It gives back a new, updated model.

((re-read the article that talks about elm's update is a state machine))

We need to make an update function. Let's ask ourselves the same questions we ask every time we make a new function:
  1. What should the function give back when it's done running?
  2. What information does the function need to do its job?

What will `update` give back when it's done running?
{: .info}
As we just said, we always keep the current state of the program in the model, so it makes sense to have `update` give back a new model when it's done running.

What does `update` need in order to give us back a new model?
{: .info}
It needs to know *what event happened*, and it needs the *current model* so that it can change it. That means `update` will have two inputs.

Let's write the skeleton of the function and then figure out the details after. We need a single word for each input, so we'll call the description for the event that occurs the "message" and the model the "model". It's just convention to name them in this way.

{% highlight elm %}
update message model =
  -- TODO: react to changes and give back a new updated model
{% endhighlight %}

A message can be any type, but it seems natural to use a String of words that will describe the event - like a real message.

Now we need to think about what messages `update` might receive that it has to react to. Our app has three buttons. We could use a generic message like "button clicked", but it wouldn't be specific enough to tell us which button was pressed and which type of picture should be shown. We *could* pass the message an input saying which type of button was pressed every time we call the update function, but that seems unnecessarily complex.

Instead, we'll have three different messages that represent each button being clicked:
  * "asked for cats"
  * "asked for dogs"
  * "asked for ice cream"

We will only ever receive one message at a time. So we need a way to make the update function do different things depending on which of the three messages it receives.

There are several ways to accomplish this. One way is to use an `if` expression, which is a way of providing control over which way a program runs.

Here's what we want to do in English. We'll translate it into Elm in a second.


If the message is "asked for cats", give back a new model where the title is "cats" and the image location is a cat picture.
{: .info}

Otherwise, if the message is "asked for dogs", give back a new model where the title is "dogs" and the image location is a dog picture.
{: .info}

Otherwise, if the message is "asked for ice cream", give back a new model where the title is "ice cream" and the image location is an ice cream picture.
{: .info}

Otherwise, we must have gotten a message that we don't know what to do with, so just give back the old model.
{: .info}

You'll notice every statement above follows a pattern. There are always three parts:

  1. a **conditional expression**, or just called a **conditional**, after "if" which represents a *yes / no question*, like

  Was the message "asked for dogs"?
  {: .info}

  2. an expression to run if the answer is *yes*, like

  Give back a new model where the title is "dogs" and the image location is a dog picture
  {: .info}

  3. an expression to run if the answer is *no*, like

  Continue checking if any other patterns match
  {: .info}

Every `if` statement follows this pattern, which makes it easy to program. Here's what the template for an "if" statement looks like:

{% highlight elm %}
if {-conditional-} then {-run this expression-} else {-run this expression instead-}
{% endhighlight %}

"If statements" are special. They're basically a fork in the road. Only one expression gets evaluated depending on the answer to the *yes / no* question. We ask a question, and if the answer is "yes", the computer runs the `then` expression and the `else` expression is completely skipped. If the answer to the question is "no", it runs the `else` expression instead.

The expressions after "then" and "else" can be *any* expression, like the ones we've been writing. But the *yes / no* question is a special kind of expression called a **conditional**.

A **conditional** can only ever result in one of two values: *yes* or *no*. Or, in programming-speak, a conditional gives back a **boolean**.

### Booleans

A **boolean** is a word for a variable that can have one of two values. In English, "yes" and "no" are booleans. So are "true" and "false" - there are only two options. It doesn't really matter what words we call the two choices, the point is that booleans can only be one of two things.

In Elm, there's a type for booleans called `Bool`. A value that's a Bool type can only be one of two things:
  1. `True`
  2. `False`

They are both capitalized because they're actually **type constructors**, not just normal variables. Type constructors sound scary, but they're actually very simple - they're expressions that **create a value of a certain type**. We've already built lots of types, we just didn't know we were using type constructors.

Quotes build a String type value, so they're String type constructors:
{% highlight elm %}
"sup"
{% endhighlight %}

Parentheses are used as Tuple type constructors, because they take in values and make a Tuple out of them.
{% highlight elm %}
(1, 2)
{% endhighlight %}

Just like typing out "Hello" creates a String type, typing out True with a capital T creates a Bool type.

Note the difference:

{% highlight elm %}
true -- I'm a regular old variable
True -- I'm a special *type constructor* for the Bool type
{% endhighlight %}

**Constructor** is used all over in programming. I'm not sure why they decided on a word that sounds so formal, but all it means is an expression that **creates something**. Object oriented languages like Java have constructors for classes because they get called when you want to make members of that class.

### Comparison Operators

So how do we make a conditional expression that outputs a boolean value? There are several functions built into Elm called **comparison** functions which take two inputs, compares them, and outputs a boolean.

Here are a few of our options for comparison functions:
  1. `>`, which is read as "greater than"
  2. `<`, which is read as "less than"
  3. `==`, which is read as "the same as"
  4. `/=`, which is read as "not the same as"

These functions are a little different from the ones we've seen so far. With most functions, we put all the inputs *after* the function name when we call them.

{% highlight elm %}
add 1 2 -- equal to 3
{% endhighlight %}

With comparison functions, we put the function *in between* the inputs.[^1] This makes things look a little more natural when we read them in our code.

{% highlight elm %}
2.5 > 10         -- False
1 < 2            -- True
'a' < 'b'        -- True
1 == 2           -- False
"Hello" /= "Hey" -- True
{% endhighlight %}

### An example `if` expression

`if` expressions are extremely important to understand, so let's walk through an example. I usually hate contrived examples, but we'll use one here to keep things simple.

Imagine we're writing a function that outputs one of two sentences depending on whether the color of the sky is blue or not. This is a perfect place for an `if` expression because we can make this into a yes/no question. We can ask "Is the sky blue?"

If the answer is yes, we want to give back the sentence "It's daytime!"

If the answer is no, we want to give back the sentence "Maybe it's nighttime?"

So we have the three things we need for the `if` expression:
  1. a yes / no question: "Is the sky blue?"
  2. an expression for if the answer is yes: "It's daytime!"
  3. an expression for if the answer is no: "Maybe it's nighttime?"

We need to write a function that checks whether the color of the sky is blue or not. We can't put spaces or question marks in function names, so we'll call it `isTheSkyBlue`.

Fortunately, this is a completely contrived example that I'm making up as we go, so let's say we have a Sky module we can import which has a function `color` that gives the current color of the sky.

We could write `isTheSkyBlue` like this:

{% highlight elm %}
istheSkyBlue color = color == "blue"
{% endhighlight %}

This can be read as,

theSkyIsBlue is a function that takes a color and checks whether the color is the same as the String "blue"
{: .info}

This function definition will give back `True` or `False`, so we can use the function in an `if` expression. This is just pseudo code, so it won't compile.

{% highlight elm %}
import Html
import Sky

theSkyIsBlue color = color == "blue"

main = if (theSkyIsBlue Sky.color)
       then Html.text "It's daytime!"
       else Html.text "Maybe it's nighttime?"
{% endhighlight %}

As with other expressions, spacing doesn't matter. So we could have written the `if` expression in one line.

Here's the flow of what's happening in the code.

![if-then-else](images/if-then-else-sky.png)

Remember, only *one* of the expressions will be evaluated. So if the conditional expression evaluates to True, the `else` condition won't do anything, even if it would do something *terrible* if it were to run.

### Adding conditional expressions to `update`

Enough examples - let's add the messages to the `update` function.

{% highlight elm %}
update message model =
  if message == "asked for cats" then           -- TODO: handle the change
  else if message == "asked for dogs" then      -- TODO: handle the change
  else if message == "asked for ice cream" then -- TODO: handle the change
  else -- TODO: the message isn't something we recognize, so do nothing
{% endhighlight %}

Here's the flow diagram of what we're doing with this code. The computer reads the lines top down and only evaluates the `else` expressions if it has to.

![if-then-else-tree](images/if-then-else-tree.png)

Ok, now we just need to handle the changes.

### Making Changes

Ok, here's what our model looks like again just so we know what we're working with.

model = ("cats", "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif")

In our `update` function, we're going to react to the message and give back a *new model*.

"Hey," you say. "We're taking in the old model as an input, so shouldn't we just change what's inside it and give it back? rather than making a whole new one?"

Nope.
{: .important}

One of the defining features that makes Elm (and frameworks like Facebook's React that are similar) so great is that you can never change data once it's been created. We're not going to *change* the existing model in the update function, we're going to make a brand new model.

Admittedly, not being able to change anything in our program sounds like a terrible design decision. But 50 years of programming research has proven otherwise. Most of the bugs that occur in programs happen from variables unexpectedly changing. It causes problems that are difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot. Take a look at Facebook's [Immutable JS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) for some more background on why not allowing data to change is a good thing and actually leads to faster code.

### Actually handling change in our `update`

Our model is just a Tuple of two Strings. So each of the `if` conditions in our code need to give back a new Tuple with different Strings inside.

Here are some image locations you can use:

{% highlight elm %}
update message model =
       if message == "asked for cats" then ("cats", image)
  else if message == "asked for dogs" then ("dogs", image)
  else if message == "asked for ice cream" then ("ice cream", image)
  else model
{% endhighlight %}

In the last line, we're just giving back the old model if the message doesn't match one of the Strings we expect our message to be.

[1]: We sometimes casually refer to functions that go in between their inputs as "infix operators". It's not a very casual-sounding word, but there you go. Infix for inside, and operator because they *operate* on the values on either side of them. I only bring this up because some languages don't have use infix operators - they only use *prefix operators*, like in Lisp. In Lisp, we would sum a bunch of numbers like this: (+ 1 6 3 7). Pretty weird!

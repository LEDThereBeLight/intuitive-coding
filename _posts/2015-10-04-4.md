Languages let us combine expressions into sentences that create larger meanings. In programming, we call a sentence a **statement**.

Computers read top-down, left-to-right just like us. Imagine you are a 5 year old just learning how to read. You don't know a lot of words, but you know some words. You can use the words you already know to help you learn more words.

You've just opened up a new book, and you read this sentence:

p.pretty Not for the first time, an 
  span.red argument 
  span had broken out over 
  span.red breakfast 
  span at number four, Privet 
  span.red Drive.

You understand the first few words and know what's going on until you get to a word you haven't seen before: "argument".

You look it up in the dictionary, and you see the definition "an exchange of opposite views". Since an expression can be replaced by its definition, you substitute those words into the sentence to make it easier for you to understand:

p.pretty Not for the first time, an 
  span.red exchange 
  span.blue of 
  span.red opposite 
  span.blue views 
  span had broken out over 
  span.red breakfast 
  span at number four, Privet 
  span.red Drive.

But you don't know what 'exchange' or 'opposite' mean, so you still can't understand the sentence.

You've got great discipline, so you decide to look up the definitions of each of those two words and substitute them into the sentence.

After substituting the definitions for 'exchange' and 'opposite' into the sentence, you end up with:

p.pretty Not for the first time, an 
  span.blue act of giving and receiving two things 
  span.blue having opposite views 
  span had broken out over 
  span.red breakfast 
  span at number four, Privet 
  span.red Drive. 

That's better, but the rest of the sentence still has some words you don't understand. So you go through the whole sentence and replace each expression or word with its definition until you get down to a sentence that has only words that you understand.

After substituting the definition for every word you don't know, you end up with a sentence you can completely understand:

p.pretty Not for the first time, an 
  span.blue act of giving and receiving two things 
  span.blue having opposite views 
  span had broken out over 
  span.blue the first meal of the day 
  span at number four, Privet 
  span.blue Carry Along by Force. 

Okay, I don't think that whole process made it much easier to read either.

But a computer does. And that's how computers work. A hardware developer starts a computer off with a small set of words it understands and can perform, actions like addition and subtraction.

We as programmers teach computers new words so that we can write using language that we understand, rather than only using commands that the computer starts off knowing.

Computers look up and replace these new words with their definitions until they get down to basic operations they know how to perform.

This is great, because it means learning to program is more like learning a language than it is like learning a science. It's just a language that tells a computer what to do. Once you learn the most common words, you can get your point across, even if you sound a little bit awkward.

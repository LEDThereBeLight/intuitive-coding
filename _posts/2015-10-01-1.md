### Our first program

Open [elm-lang.org/try](http://www.elm-lang.org/try) in a new tab, and let's draw something on the screen.

Copy and paste this Elm code into the editor and run it with the *Compile* button.

{% highlight hs %}
import Html

main = Html.text "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."
{% endhighlight %}

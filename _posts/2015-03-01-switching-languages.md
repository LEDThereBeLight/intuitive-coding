### Where to go from here

I'm building this out, but in the meantime, here are some places to get you started.

Coding for interviews:

  * Learn [computer science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)
  * Learn [data structures and algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)
  * Do [practice problems](http://codewars.com/)

Artificial Intelligence:

  * Learn [the basics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/lecture-videos/)
  * Implement the algorithms
  * Practice [with a game](http://www.screeps.com)


### Plans for the future:

Switching to the Javascript language and continuing with coding:

  * data structures (linked lists, queues, arrays)
  * basic algorithms
    * sorting, hashing, searching
  * object oriented programming
  * state machines
  * modeling problems with graphs - choice and decision making, not "graph theory"

The idea is to work through interview questions in each section with a guide on how to think about solving the problems.

Later:

  * artificial intelligence
  	* goal trees
  	* rule based systems
  	* game theory and searching
  	* constraints
  	* visual recognition
  	* neural nets
  	* machine learning

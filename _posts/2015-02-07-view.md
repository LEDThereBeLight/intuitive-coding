### Using the model in the *view*

A model doesn't do any good on its own. We need to feed it into the program.

How do we do that? As we have our program set up right now, all of our page components are sitting inside `main`. It may not have been obvious until now, but our entire `main` definition has a single purpose - it shows a webpage. So instead of leaving everything in `main` cluttering it up, we're going to define a new function and replace our code in `main` with that.

So what should we call this new function? We don't have to be creative - programmers have a name for it, the **view**. The view is everything that the user can see at the moment.

We need to make a view function. Whenever we create a function, we ask two questions:

  1. What should the function give back when it's done running?
  2. What information does the function need to do its job?

What should `view` give back when it's done running?
{: .info}

We're going to use our view to create an HTML webpage, so the output of the function will be an Html value that `main` can use.

What information does `view` need to do its job?
{: .info}

We're going to take the model, the current state of the program, and feed it into the view to decide what to show on the screen.

In other words,

`view` is a function that takes a `model` as input and produces an expression of type Html.
{: .info}

In case you're skeptical about having to do this extra work, there really is a good reason for separating out the view. In our app it really doesn't matter, but in real applications the reason we separate out the view, or the **front end**, is so that it can be easily replaced without affecting the functionality, or the **back end**, of the app. It's typical to go through several iterations of designs, and it's much easier to deploy redesigns when the look and feel isn't baked into how the app works - you know exactly where to go to make changes.

### Defining a function with inputs

So far, we've *used* functions that accept inputs, but we haven't *defined* any ourselves. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to do in Elm - much easier than in most other languages. We just put the names of the inputs after the name of the variable.

Here's an example of defining a function that takes two numbers and adds them:

{% highlight elm %}
add one two = one + two
{% endhighlight %}

`one` and `two` are inputs to the `add` function, so they go on the left side of the `=` sign. They're then both used in the function definition expression on the right side.

Once we've defined our function, we can use it by calling it and giving it two inputs, just like we would with any other function.

{% highlight elm %}
add 1 2 -- call add with 1 and 2, giving us back 3

add 15 15 -- call add with 15 and 15, giving us back 30
{% endhighlight %}

There's something we need to keep in mind when defining functions that take inputs. It takes awhile to get comfortable with, but is extremely important:

`one` and `two` are ONLY accessible in the function definition. We can't call those specific variable names anywhere else in our program!
{: .info}

For example, writing something like this *will not work*:

{% highlight elm %}
import Html

add one two = one + two

main = Html.text one
{% endhighlight %}

You'll get this error:

![number1 undefined](images/number-undefined.png)

That's because when we define a function that takes inputs, the input names are only available in the function's definition. This idea in programming is called **scope**. As in, "the **scope** of `one` and `two` is limited to the definition of the function `add`."

Okay, I think it's finally time to make the `view`.

### Defining our view

Let's make a new variable called `view` that takes one input, the model, and define it to be everything we currently have in `main`.

{% highlight elm %}
view model = Html.div
  [ pageStyling ]
  [
    Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Html.text "cats" ],
    Html.input [ searchboxStyling ] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "cats" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "dogs" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "ice cream" ],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif" ] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can replace the definition of `main` with the following:
{% highlight elm %}
main = view model
{% endhighlight %}

We're defining view to accept an input which we'll call "model" for use in our definition. Note that even though the input we give `view` in `main` has the same name as the `model` we defined up above, these are *different variables*. This goes back to *scope*.

{% highlight elm %}
model = blah
main = view model
{% endhighlight %}
**The `models` are not the same!**

((Need a gif showing how bound parameters work))!!

 The `model` input here in our view has no meaning until we *call* the `view` function and pass our *real* model into it as an input.

### Using the model in the view

We need to replace the static, unchanging parts of our app with content from the model.

Remember, our model has two parts:
  1. title text
  2. an image location

And it looks like this:
{% highlight elm %}
model = ("cats", "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif")
{% endhighlight %}

So how do we get the two parts out of the model?

Our model is a Tuple, and the Tuple module comes with two handy functions: `first` and `second`. The Tuple module is always available in Elm, so we don't need to import it.

So to get the title, we can say

{% highlight elm %}
Tuple.first model
{% endhighlight %}

And to get the image location, we can say

{% highlight elm %}
Tuple.second model
{% endhighlight %}

### Replacing the title text with the model

Change `Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Html.text "cats" ]` to `Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Tuple.first model ]`
{: .info}

{% highlight elm %}
Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Tuple.first model ]
{% endhighlight %}

Run the program and make sure it works.

### Replacing the image location with the model

Change `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif" ] []` to `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src Tuple.second model ] []`
{: .info}

{% highlight elm %}
Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src Tuple.second model ] []
{% endhighlight %}

Now run the program. What happens?

Oops. We get two errors.

![missing-parens](images/missing-parens-error.png)

The first error is a little confusing, but it actually comes as a result of the second, so we can ignore it for now. Knowing which errors are root causes and which are just symptoms comes with experience.

The second error says,

"Function `src` is expecting 1 argument, but was given 2."
{: .important}

Let's talk about what this means.

**Argument** is just a synonym for "input". It's what we are giving to the function when we call it.

So Elm thinks we're giving `Html.Attributes.src` two inputs, when we really mean to give it one. The issue is that we have a space between them, so Elm thinks `Tuple.second` and `model` are separate.

So we need to group these two terms into one expression.

Fortunately, Elm gives us a hint on how to do that. Below the error, it says,

"Maybe you forgot some parentheses? Or a comma?"
{: .important}

We can put both terms inside parentheses to group them.

Change `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src Tuple.second model ] []` to `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src (Tuple.second model) ] []`
{: .info}

{% highlight elm %}
Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src (Tuple.second model) ] []
{% endhighlight %}

Note that these parentheses don't make a Tuple - there is no comma separating the terms. These parentheses just tell Elm to group the words together into a single expression.

Whew, that was a lot! I'm exhausted just from writing that, so don't be frustrated if it doesn't make sense your first time through. It takes *everyone* several repetitions for it to sink in. Now go eat a cookie, you deserve it!

Here's our final code so far:

{% highlight elm %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

model = ("cats", "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif")

view model = Html.div
  [ pageStyling ]
  [
    Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Tuple.first model ],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "cats" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "dogs" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "ice cream" ],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src Tuple.second model ] []
  ]

main = view model
{% endhighlight %}

### Starting our Elm program

We'll start this program the way we start every Elm program, by importing the Html module and defining the `main` function.

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html

main = Html.text "Starting text"
{% endhighlight %}

This produces the following result:

Starting text
{: .answer}

Let's change our program to display an image instead of text. The Html module has lots of different functions for displaying things on a page - `text` is just one of them. You can see all the different options at [Elm's docs](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html), but we haven't learned how to even read the docs yet, so we'll be explaining the functions we need in detail here.

### A quick note on HTML

You can continue this section without any knowledge of HTML, but it will be clearer if you understand some basic concepts of the language. HTML is a pretty simple language, so if you've never seen it before, I recommend taking an hour and skimming the HTML section on [marksheet.io](http://marksheet.io/html-basics.html). You don't need to know much about HTML, but you should know three things:
  * How to recognize HTML when you see it
  * Some of the most common elements, such as `div`, `img`, `a`, and `p`
  * How HTML elements combine to build a page (hint: elements are **nested**, or placed within other elements).

I'll do my best to explain things as we go, but a little bit of background knowledge will help.

### The Elm `img` function

Every HTML element is available in Elm as a function, and they have the same name as their HTML counterpart:
  * `div`, `span`
  * `h1`
  * `p`
  * `ul`, `li`
  * `br`


All of these HTML functions in the Elm Html module take two inputs:
  1. A list of HTML attributes
  2. A list of children elements

### Displaying an image

Let's use the `img` function to draw an image on the page.

Replace `Html.text "Starting text"` with `Html.img [] []`, then compile.
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html

main = Html.img [] []
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="#"/>
{: .answer}

What we're doing here is creating an image element and providing an empty list of attributes and an empty list of children elements.

### A source for our image

There's an image element on our page, but we haven't told Elm the address for where our image is located, so nothing shows up. Let's add a **source** for the image by using the HTML `src` attribute.

The Elm Html module only has functions for HTML elements. To add an HTML attribute, we need to import another module, appropriately named `Html.Attributes`.

Import the Html.Attributes module, and change the first input of the `img` element from `[]` to `[Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"]`
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif">
{: .answer}

Progress. Now we've set the source location of our image element to an image URL, so a picture shows up on the page.

### The rest of our page

Now let's add a title for our image topic, a search bar, and a button that we will use later to trigger a search.

Here are the functions we'll need:
  * `h1`, for the title
  * `input`, for the search bar
  * `button`, for the search button
  * `br`, for adding line breaks to space out our elements

### Wrapping our elements

We want to add another HTML element to our `main` function, but if we do that we'll run into a problem: function definitions only accept a *single expression* as a definition. So how do we add more elements while keeping the definition of `main` as a single expression?

The answer is to use an HTML `div` element that will contain all of the page elements that we want to display. Divs are meaningless, they're just used to group together elements in a page, which is exactly what we need.

Let's nest our `img` element within a `div` as the second input to the function.
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

### Adding a heading

Now we can add as many HTML elements as we want by just adding to the list and separating the elements with commas.

Let's add a heading with the code `h1 [] []`
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1></h1><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

This will create a line for our heading with an empty list of attributes and an empty list of children elements.

### Filling in our heading

The heading is there, but it doesn't have any text. We already know how to add text: we can use our favorite function, `Html.text`. We're putting the text *inside* the heading element, so it should go inside the second input to the h1 function.

Change the second input to the `h1` function from `[]` to `[Html.text "cats"]`.
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1>cats</h1><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

### A search bar

Right under the heading, let's add a search bar that we can use to get gifs from different categories.

Add a line below the `h1` element with the code `input [] []`
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.input [] [],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1>cats</h1>
<input/><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

### A search button

Now let's add a button that we can use to trigger a search and refresh the image.

Add a line below the `input` element with the code `button [] [Html.text "more!"]`
{: .info}

<div><h1>cats</h1><input/><button>more!</button><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

### Some breathing room

Finally, let's space things out so we have a little more room.

Add some `br [] []` lines to create new lines between our elements.
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    input [] [],
    br [] [],
    br [] [],
    button [] [Html.text "more!"],
    br [] [],
    br [] [],
    img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1>cats</h1><input/><br/><br/><button>more!</button><br/><br/><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>

### A detour

By far, the most complicated part of our app is going to be the part that allows us to search for a GIF on the internet and display it on the page. (Unfortunately, it's also about the only interesting part). We'll work up to that, but for now it makes sense to start with something slightly simpler until we can see how all the pieces of the app will fit together.

Instead of adding a search bar, for now we're going to add a few buttons that the user can click on to show GIFs from different categories. This will dramatically simplify our app and allow us to tackle the steps involved in searching the internet one at a time, after we have a working app already.

Here's what we're going to start with:

![cats, dogs, and ice cream](/images/app-mvu.png)

### Building the rest of the page

We need to add the title and buttons to our page.

Here are the functions we'll need:
  * `h1`, for the title
  * `button`, for the search button
  * `br`, for adding line breaks to space out our elements

### Wrapping our elements

We want to add some more HTML elements to our `main` function, but if we do that we'll run into a problem: definitions only accept a *single expression* to the right of the `=` sign. So how do we add more elements while keeping the definition of `main` as a single expression?

The answer is to use an HTML `div` element that will contain all of the other page elements that we want to display. Divs are meaningless, they're just used to group together elements in a page, which is exactly what we need.

Let's nest our `img` element within a `div` as the second input to the function.
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

### Adding a heading

Now we can add as many HTML elements as we want by just adding to the `div`'s List of children elements and separating the elements with commas.

Let's add a heading with the line `h1 [] []`. Don't forget a comma at the end!
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1></h1><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

This will create a line for our heading with an empty List of attributes and an empty List of children elements.

### Filling in our heading

The heading is there, but it doesn't have any text. We already know how to add text: we can use our favorite function, `Html.text`. We're putting the text *inside* the heading element, so it should go inside the second input to the h1 function.

Change the second input to the `h1` function from `[]` to `[Html.text "cats"]`.
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1>cats</h1><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

<!-- ### A search bar

Right under the heading, let's add a search bar that we can use to get gifs from different categories.

Add a line below the `h1` element with the code `input [] []`
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.input [] [],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1>cats</h1>
<input/><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer} -->

### Some buttons

Now let's add a few buttons that we can press to trigger new GIFs.

Add three lines below the `h1` element with the code `button [] [Html.text "topic"]`, and then change the text to the three categories of pictures you want to show.
{: .info}

We'll use cats, dogs, and ice cream for our categories.

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.button [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.button [] [Html.text "dogs"],
    Html.button [] [Html.text "ice cream"],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1>cats</h1><button>cats</button><button>dogs</button><button>ice cream</button><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

### Some breathing room

Finally, let's space things out so we have a little more room between our elements. We can use HTML `br` tags for this.

Add some `br [] []` lines to create new lines between our elements. Each `br` is one new line.
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Html.Attributes

main = Html.div
  []
  [
    Html.h1 [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.button [] [Html.text "cats"],
    Html.button [] [Html.text "dogs"],
    Html.button [] [Html.text "ice cream"],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.img [Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

<div><h1>cats</h1><br/><br/><button>cats</button><button>dogs</button><button>ice cream</button><br/><br/><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif"></div>
{: .answer}

You might be wondering why there's more spacing after the `h1` heading than after the buttons. The reason is because HTML has two types of elements: [**inline** and **block** elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements#Block-level_vs._inline).

Block elements, like `h1` and `div`, take up the entire line. So when we use the first `br` element after the `h1`, we're *starting* on the next line after it. So two `br`s make two empty lines.

Inline elements *don't* take up the entire line. So when we use the first `br` element after the `button`, it's bringing us to the next line below the buttons, and then the second `br` creates an empty row.

### Iteration and Recursion

Most problems in coding can be solved by doing the same thing over and over until you get the answer. Learning how to code is largely about starting to see how to split a problem up into a series of steps that can be repeated.

There are two main ways to repeat a task: **iterative** processes and **recursive** processes. Recursive processes tend to be easier to understand, but some languages have a defect in their compilers which makes recursive functions use more memory than iterative processes. Unfortunately, Javascript is one of those languages.

Usually, using more memory doesn't matter, because computers have so much of it it doesn't make a difference. In these cases, you should solve the problem using the method you find simplest. Sometimes, resources do matter - if you're doing tens of thousands of computations or more. In those cases, you should use the iterative process.

It's important to learn both ways to solve problems, iterative and recursive, because it depends on what you're trying to optimize - your own time as a developer, or your computer's memory.

### In short

We wrote a small program that takes a sentence and prints it on the page.

Here's what our program looks like in Elm.

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html

main = Html.text "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."
{% endhighlight %}

And here are the two lines in English:

Import the "Html" module for use in our code.
{: .quote}
Define "main" to be the result of running the following functional expression: Look inside the "Html" module to find the "text" function, then give that function as an input the string of characters "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."
{: .quote}

Elm automatically takes the result and displays it on the page.

*[import]: Bring in a module to use in our code
*[Html%2Etext]: Look inside the Html module for a function named text
*[Html]: A specific module with functions to translate our code into HTML
*[main]: Elm looks for this word, runs its definition, and displays the result on the page
*[text]: A function that takes a String and gives back code for an HTML webpage
*[=]: Define a word
*["Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."]: A String that we use as input for Html's text function

### Keeping track of things with *state*

So now we have a working web page with a few buttons and an image. But it doesn't *do* anything. So how do we add functionality to the page?

The main gap in our knowledge right now is that we don't know how to make a program with **state**. State is the current situation of our program. Think about water. Depending on the temperature, water can have different states of solid, liquid, and gas. But in our program, we just run our code and get a single result, which Elm spits out on the page. Nothing can change based on different conditions.

If we want to make something interactive, we're going to need to be able to react to changes. Think about all the things Facebook has to keep track of to know what to show on the page. It has to know whether the current user is logged in or not, the user's friends, posts that were made recently, and so on.
<!-- 
First, a quick note: things are about to ramp up pretty quickly here. We're going to introduce some programming concepts that are core to just about every app but take a little time to get comfortable with. Don't be frustrated if it doesn't make sense right away - it sure didn't for me. But it will come. -->

### The state is stored in the *model*

The **model** is a collection of everything we need to keep track of in our program. It represents the current state of our program, and what it looks like depends entirely on the program we're building.

### Examples

This clock has a three-part model which keeps track of the position of each hand.

Flappy Bird has a model that keeps track of your score and current position.

### Our program's model

Before we can add functionality to our page, we need to create a model that will keep track of the things that will change.

Here's a picture of our app again.

What do you think the model of our program will be?

I see two things that change that we need to keep track of:

Our model will have two parts: one for the title, and one for the image location. Both of these parts will be Strings. And since it's a set of two, we'll use a Tuple to keep them together.

Let's create a new function called `model`. We're going to use the model to tell our app what to show on the page, so we need to give it some starting values so it has something to display when we first load the page. 

We'll use "cats" as our starting topic, and an image location that I found on [giphy](http://www.giphy.com).

model = ("cats", "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif")

<!-- To make a model, we need to create our own type. Remember types? They're categories for values. We've already learned about the Character, List, and String types. These types are built into Elm. But types aren't special - we can make our own if we want. 

And here's a place where we want to make a new type, called a Model. But we don't have a real understanding of types yet. Before we can make our own, we need to explain a few more ideas about how they work. -->

[1]: Readers with some background knowledge will realize that our explanation of the model here is an extreme simplification of the actual idea of a model. System architectures have different representations of models depending on the perspective that is relevant at the time. For example, programs have **system** models, which consist of the parts that make up how the system actually works on the backend. What we talk about here is actually the **interface** model, the model that the application exposes to the user through the view. There's also the model created from how the user *thinks* the program works, which is called the **user** model. This model isn't programmed at all, it simply exists in the mind - but it still has an effect on the user experience of the application because it determines how a user will approach problem solving using the program. We should design programs with interfaces models that more closely match the user model than they do system models, since that creates more natural user experiences.

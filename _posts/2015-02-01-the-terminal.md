### What we're going to make

Let's learn how to build something. [Our app](/giffetch.html) is going to have two main features. It:

  * Lets you search for a topic
  * Gets a GIF from the internet and displays it on the page

It's a simple app on the surface, but we'll need to use some pretty cutting-edge technology to bring everything together and make it work without any page reloading. Building this app will teach us some of the most important coding skills that are important for any area, whether you're interested in building apps, data science, or AI.

### Getting set up

We could code our entire app in the online Elm editor at [elm-lang.org](https://www.elm-lang.org/). But let's spend a few minutes setting up our computer so that we can do it the way coders normally do. At the end, we'll be able to publish our site so that we can see it live on the internet.

We need three programs. I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how to install them:

  1. the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html">Elm language</a>
  2. a text editor to code in. I recommend <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>, which is free.
  3. <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">Git</a>, a fancy way of saving files

If you use Atom, you'll want to download a plugin for syntax highlighting in Elm, which you can do by going to Settings, Install, and searching for "language-elm".

And that's all we need.

### How to look like a hacker

In the beginning, before Start menus and Finders, there was only one way to interact with a computer: a simple program called a terminal. Terminals are still around, and you can use them to do anything you're used to doing by clicking around on the screen. You can work with files on your computer, give your computer commands to run, or even download and install programs from the internet.

The terminal can look intimidating at first, because even modern terminal programs haven't changed much since the 60s. So why learn how to use the an archaic program like a "terminal"? Well, the simple answer is that once you learn it, it makes doing common tasks much faster. While the user experience of using a terminal leaves something to be desired, you quickly get used to it.

If you've never used the terminal before, I recommend skimming the first chapter of [Learn Enough's Command Line Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial). A big part of learning to code is learning the ecosystem around it, and getting comfortable in the command line is part of that. I'm only going to assume you know how to open up the program on your computer.

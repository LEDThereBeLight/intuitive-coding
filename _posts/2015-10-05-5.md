### Making new words

Let's look at the code we wrote again.

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html

main = Html.text "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."
{% endhighlight %}

The first line with `import Html` is a **command**, which is another type of expression that we'll come back to soon.

The second line says to create a new word called `main` and define it to be:
```haskell
Html.text "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."
```

We use the `=` symbol to make new words.

`=` is a symbol that takes two expressions:
1. A **name** to call the word, which we put on the left
2. A **definition** for the word, which we put on the right

So why on earth would we want to make a new word called `main`?

The answer is that many programming languages (Elm included) are designed to look for a `main` function to run at the beginning of the program. This is a way to start our program off. Elm takes the definition of the `main` function that we wrote, runs it, and shows the output on the screen.

But `main` is very particular about the kinds of things it is willing to show on the screen.

`main` won't accept just *anything* and show it on the screen. It only considers showing a certain type of expression.

A **type** is a category that we decide an expression falls into. There are lots of different types, and we always capitalize their names to make them easier to tell apart from other kinds of words, like functions.

`'a'` is a **Character** type, because it's a single letter. Characters go inside single quotes.

**List** is a type that can hold another type. Just like Characters go inside `' '`, Lists have their own symbol that they go inside. Lists use square brackets: `[ ]`. To make things clearer, each item in a list is separated by a comma.

Say you have a bunch of individual Characters:
  * `'h'`
  * `'e'`
  * `'l'`
  * `'l'`
  * `'o'`

Characters are great all by themselves, but sometimes we want to put them together to make words. We can string letters together to make words by putting them inside a List, like this:

`['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`  

But since it's pretty common to talk about words in our programs, we don't have to use write them out as Lists of Characters with square brackets and single quotes going every which way. There's another type that exists as a kind of shorthand for Lists of Characters. It's called a **String**, and we make one with double quotes: `" "`.

{% highlight haskell %}
"Who's this Rorschach dude and why is he so good at drawing pictures of my dad beating me?"
{% endhighlight %}

So why do we use quotes for letters and words? There's a good reason. Let's switch back to English for a moment. I'm going to tell you to do something.

### Say your name.

The two words "your" and "name" combine to make an expression that represents a specific name: **yours**.
### Say "your name"

This sentence means to literally say the words in quotations - there's no meaning behind them.

Coding uses the same idea. If we are writing code and want to talk about actual letters or words themselves, rather than the ideas they represent, we put the letters in quotations.

### So, to recap
* Single letters go in single quotes, and we call them *Characters*
* Multiple letters go in double quotes, and we call them *Strings*

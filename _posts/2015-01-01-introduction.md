<!-- I've always found it funny how the whole world is obsessed with wizards and magic but almost no one has any desire to try the magic that actually exists in the world.

I remember reading Harry Potter as a kid. I would think to myself, "if only we had magic in the real world - life would be so exciting! I'd do nothing but study magic and become the best wizard in the world."

Well, it turns out we do have magic. It's called coding, and it allows us to do things that would make Dumbledore jealous. We can create machines that clean our clothes or wake us up in the morning, and robots that drive around our living rooms and vacuum our floors.

Wizards in the movies dedicate years of their lives reading dusty old books that look like they're written in ancient, cryptic languages. And that's actually not a bad description for what it feels like watching someone program in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

But learning to program shouldn't be difficult. Anyone can be a coder - there are no muggles. All it takes is time to learn the language. The problem with the way most people teach coding is that they start with rules and theory using using the language of math. And when you don't have an intuitive understanding of math, programming seems even more difficult. But programming is more like a language than a science. It's a set of words for ideas, so there are many other ways to teach it.
 -->
The first language I tried to learn was C++. It's an easy trap to fall into. At the time, I thought I should be learning the languages most other people use. They must be popular for a good reason, right?

But the truth is that we can make the computer speak any language we want, so why use a language that's difficult to program in? Computers have come a long way in the last 60 years, and we don't need to program the way we did back then.

Javascript and Java are popular languages, but they're not easy to program in. So instead of conforming, we're going to take advantage of the technological advances in the last few years and start by learning a modern language called Elm. This language allows us to create modern applications in a fraction of the time of the more "popular" languages. More importantly, it also enforces good coding practices by design, so you can learn to program the right way naturally and then take those good habits to larger languages that allow you to do anything, whether it's a good idea or not.

<!-- ### But I need to learn Javascript to get a job!

If you want to learn Javascript, or Python, or any other mainstream language, trust me when I tell you that starting with Elm to learn the underlying concepts will make your life easier. My goal is to get you to learn coding as quickly as possible, not to push any specific language on you. The concepts you will learn through Elm will *all* transfer over to the other languages. Besides, once you know how to code, you're realize the language *doesn't matter*. -->

Let's begin.

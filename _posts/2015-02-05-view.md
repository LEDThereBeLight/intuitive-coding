### Using the model in the *view*

A model doesn't do any good on its own. We need to feed it into the program.

How do we do that? As we have our program set up right now, all of our page components are sitting inside `main`. It may not have been obvious until now, but our entire `main` definition has a single purpose - it shows a webpage. So instead of leaving everything in `main` cluttering it up, we're going to define a new function and replace our code in `main` with that.

So what should we call this new function? We don't have to be creative - programmers have a name for it, the **view**. The view is everything that the user can see at the moment.

The model and the view work together. We take the model, the current state of the program, and feed it into the view to know what to show on the screen.

In other words, 

`view` is a function that takes a `model` as input and produces an Html webpage.
{: .info}

### Defining a function with inputs

So far, we've used functions that accept inputs, but we haven't defined any ourselves. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to do in Elm - we put their names after the function name.

Here's an example of defining a function that takes two numbers and adds them:

{% highlight haskell %}
sum number1 number2 = number1 + number2
{% endhighlight %}

`number1` and `number2` are inputs on the left side of the `=` sign and are then both used in the function definition on the right side.

Once we've defined our function, we can use it by calling it and giving it two inputs, just like we would with any other function.

{% highlight haskell %}
sum 1 2 -- call sum with 1 and 2, giving us back 3

sum 15 15 -- call sum with 15 and 15, giving us back 30
{% endhighlight %}

There's something we need to keep in mind when defining functions that take inputs. It takes awhile to get comfortable with, but is extremely important:

`number1` and `number2` are ONLY accessible in the function definition. We can't call those specific variable names anywhere else in our program!
{: .info}

For example, writing something like this WILL NOT WORK:

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html

sum number1 number2 = number1 + number2

main = Html.text number1
{% endhighlight %}

You'll get this error:

![number1 undefined](images/number-undefined.png)

That's because when we define a function that takes inputs, the input names are only available in the function's definition.

Okay, I think it's finally time to make the view.

### Defining our view

Let's make a new function called `view` and define it to be everything we currently have in `main`.

{% highlight haskell %}
view model = Html.div
  [ pageStyling ]
  [
    Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Html.text "cats" ],
    Html.input [ searchboxStyling ] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "cats" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "dogs" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling ] [ Html.text "ice cream" ],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif" ] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

We're defining view to accept an input which we'll call "model" for use in our definition. Note that even though our view's input has the same name as the `model` we defined up above, these are different variables. The `model` input here in our view has no meaning until we *call* the `view` function and pass our *real* model into it as an input.

### Using the model in the view

We need to replace the static parts of our app with content from the model.

Remember, our model has two parts:
  1. title text
  2. an image location
  
And it looks like this:
{% highlight haskell %}
model = ("cats", "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif")
{% endhighlight %}

So how do we get the two parts out of the model?

Our model is a Tuple, and the Tuple model comes with two handy functions: `first` and `second`. The Tuple module is always available in Elm, so we don't need to import it.

So to get the title, we can say

{% highlight haskell %}
Tuple.first model
{% endhighlight %}

And to get the image location, we can say

{% highlight haskell %}
Tuple.second model
{% endhighlight %}

### Replacing the title text with the model

Change `Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Html.text "cats" ]` to `Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Tuple.first model ]`
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Tuple.first model ]
{% endhighlight %}

Run the program and make sure it works.

### Replacing the image location with the model

Change `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src "https://media.giphy.com/media/11s7Ke7jcNxCHS/giphy.gif" ] []` to `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src Tuple.second model ] []`
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src Tuple.second model ] []
{% endhighlight %}

Now run the program. What happens?

We get two errors. 

![missing-parens](images/missing-parens-error.png)

The first error is a little confusing, but it actually comes as a result of the second, so we can ignore it for now. Knowing which errors are root causes and which are just symptoms comes with experience.

It says,

"Function `src` is expecting 1 argument, but was given 2."
{: .important}

Let's talk about what this means.

**Argument** is just a synonym for "input". It's what we are giving to the function when we call it.

So Elm thinks we're giving `Html.Attributes.src` two inputs, when we really mean to give it one. The issue is that we have a space between them, so Elm thinks `Tuple.second` and `model` are separate. 

So we need to group these two terms into one expression.

Fortunately, Elm gives us a hint on how to do that. Below the error, it says,

"Maybe you forgot some parentheses? Or a comma?"
{: .important}

We can put both terms inside parentheses to group them.

Change `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src Tuple.second model ] []` to `Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src (Tuple.second model) ] []`
{: .info}

{% highlight haskell %}
Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src (Tuple.second model) ] []
{% endhighlight %}

Note that these parentheses don't make a Tuple - there is no comma separating the terms. These parentheses just tell Elm to group the words together into a single expression.

Whew, that was a lot! Don't be frustrated if it doesn't make sense your first time through. It takes *everyone* several repetitions for it to sink in. So go eat a cookie, you deserve it!

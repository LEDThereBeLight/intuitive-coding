### Learning to code by building apps

Programming is usually taught by starting with syntax.

The idea is that once you know the fundamentals, complex programs will make sense. The trouble is that you have no idea what is important to understand and how it all fits together, and so it's easy to give up before it clicks.

Instead, we'll learn as we build an app that fetches GIFs and displays them on the page, sort of like Tumblr. Ideas will only be presented as we need them for our project.

<!-- When I first started to learn programming, I had some big questions that went unanswered for a long time. I remember thinking to myself, "Why are there so many languages? Does it matter which one I choose?" or "There are a million functions in the documentation for this language, how do I know which ones are important to know and which ones I can lookup later?"

The goal of this site is to teach you how to learn to program. You won't know every language or framework, but you will know the main ideas that are common across every language. -->

<!-- We'll be teaching by example so that you know why you need to understand each idea. Oh, and I'm just going to set your expectations before we begin: there's simply *no way* to understand everything your first time through. Too many concepts are dependent on one another, they can't all be explained in isolation. That's a big part of the reason learning to program feels so difficult when you first start. You think you should be understanding everything that's being said, when really you're not expected to. You will pick it up in time. Just remember that the feeling of confusion is your friend: it means you're *learning*. The only way to learn is by repetition. Not rote memorization, but repetition - slowly growing in knowledge over time. -->

<!-- Lots of courses teach programming using a single language, say Python or Java. The benefit is that you can become comfortable with one way of doing things. But I actually think this is a mistake for new developers. If you have only been exposed to one language, you waste a lot of time trying to make the problem fit into your language's way of doing things, when you could solve it easily using another language or technique. -->

<!-- We'll learn enough of a few languages to understand the core problem solving techniques that are common between every language and then start to see how different languages are better at solving different problems. -->

*[variables]: names for data
*[conditionals]: rules for when to do one thing versus another
*[syntax]: rules for how to order words in a language
*[data structures]: categories for data, like Character for letters or Integer for numbers

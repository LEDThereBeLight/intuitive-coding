### Learning to code by building apps

Programming is usually taught by starting with the rules of a language.

The idea is that once you know the fundamentals, complex programs will make sense. The trouble is that you have no idea what is important to understand and how it all fits together, and so it's easy to give up before it clicks.

Instead, we'll learn as we build an app that fetches GIFs and displays them on the page, sort of like Tumblr. And we'll only introduce ideas as we need them. Here's what we're going to build. It won't be easy, and you're going to feel confused your first time through. But that's *normal*, and everyone goes through it. You'll be amazed how quickly things become "obvious" when they seemed impossibly hard only recently.

<!-- When I first started to learn programming, I had some big questions that went unanswered for a long time. I remember thinking to myself, "Why are there so many languages? Does it matter which one I choose?" or "There are a million functions in the documentation for this language, how do I know which ones are important to know and which ones I can lookup later?"

The goal of this site is to teach you how to learn to program. You won't know every language or framework, but you will know the main ideas that are common across every language. -->

### Where to go from here

What are you interested in? I'm building this out, but in the meantime, here are some places to get you started.

Web / App Development:

I recommend getting comfortable with Elm and building some small projects, and then following up with Javascript afterwards. Most tech giants and startups use Javascript for their webapps, so it's probably the best use of your time. Most of the concepts you learn with Elm will transfer over into Javascript, but you'll just have to deal with the inconsistencies that come with a larger language.

If you liked coding in Elm, try the unofficial [Elm Tutorial](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/) or the official [Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/). The [Elm Slack channel](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/) is also full of people who love to help.

Coding for Interviews:

  * Learn [computer science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)
  * Learn [data structures and algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)
  * Do [practice problems](http://codewars.com/)

Artificial Intelligence:

  * Learn [the basics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/lecture-videos/) and implement the algorithms
  * Practice [with a game](http://www.screeps.com)

### Plans for the future:

Switching to the Javascript language and continuing with coding:

  * data structures (linked lists, queues, arrays)
  * basic algorithms
    * sorting, hashing, searching
  * object oriented programming
  * state machines
  * modeling problems with graphs - choice and decision making, not "graph theory"

The idea is to teach the ideas through solving interview questions.

<!-- Later, I'd like to cover:

  * artificial intelligence
	* goal trees
	* rule based systems
	* game theory and searching
	* constraints
	* visual recognition
	* neural nets
	* machine learning -->

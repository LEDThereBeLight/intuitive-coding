In programming, every language uses the same ideas, but has different ways of accomplishing the same things. It's important to be comfortable with several different languages, because different problems are easier to solve using different methods. The more languages you know, the more ways you can think about how to solve a particular problem.

We're going to switch from Elm to the Javascript language. Javascript is philosophically harder than Elm, because it lets you change things once you make them. Variables are really *variable*, and it's important to be careful with what you're changing. Javascript also happens to be plagued by a lot of unfortunate design decisions.

But Javascript has a lot of advantages that make it a fantastic language to learn. It's more popular than Elm and has [the largest](https://www.npmjs.com/) module ecosystem of *any language* built up around it, so we can take advantage of more code that other people have written to do complicated things without having to write everything ourselves.

Javascript is also flexible, supporting a variety of coding patterns - so we can learn to solve problems in different ways without having to switch languages.

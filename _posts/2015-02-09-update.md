### The update

So now we've split our program into a model and a view. But it's still *static*! It seems like we did a lot of work for nothing, but that's just because we're missing the third and final piece of the puzzle: the **update**.

The update is where the magic happens. It's where we describe what to do depending on what changes in our program. It's usually called a Controller, like in [Model View Controller](wikipedia or something), but Elm's take on things is a little different, so it's appropriate to name it something else.

Elm uses the idea of a **state machine** which is used throughout computer programming. State machines are simple "machines" in the form of a function that takes in the current state and an event that occurs, and gives back a new state.

We need to make an update function, so let's ask ourselves the same questions we ask every time we make a new function:

  1. What should the function give back when it's done running?
  2. What information does the function need to do its job?

In our case, the current state is stored in the model, so we want to get a new model back from the function. The function will need two inputs: the current state, which is stored in the model, and a description for how to change the model based on the event. The `update` function will then use that description to build the new model.

Let's write the skeleton of the function and then figure out the details after. We need a single word for each input, so we'll call the description for the event that occurs the "message" and the model the "model". It's just convention to name them in this way.

{% highlight haskell %}
update message model =
  -- TODO: react to changes and give back a new updated model
{% endhighlight %}

A message can be any type, but it seems natural to use a String of words that will describe the event - like a real message.

Now we need to think about what messages `update` might receive that it has to react to. Our app has three buttons, so we need to send a different message for each button so that the `update` function knows which one was clicked. We *could* make the message a function that takes an input saying which type of button was pressed, but that seems unnecessarily complex.

Instead, we'll have three different messages that represent each button being clicked:
  * "asked for cats"
  * "asked for dogs"
  * "asked for ice cream"

We will only ever receive one message at a time, so we just need to change the `update` function to react to each of the three messages it could receive. Here's what we want to do in English. We'll translate it into Elm in a second.

1. If the message is "asked for cats", return a model where the title is "cats" and the image is a picture of a cat<br>
2. Else if the message is "asked for dogs", return a model where the title is "dogs" and the image is a picture of a dog<br>
3. Else if the message is "asked for ice cream", return a model where the title is "ice cream" and the image is a picture of ice cream<br>
4. Else we must have gotten a message that we don't know what to do with, so just return the old model
{: .info}

You'll notice every statement above follows a pattern. There are always three parts:

* a **conditional expression**, or just called a **conditional**, after "if" which represents a *yes / no question*, like

Was the message "asked for dogs"?
{: .info}

* an expression to run if the answer is *yes*, like

Return a model where the title is "cats" and the image is a picture of a cat
{: .info}

* an expression to run if the answer is *no*, like

Continue checking if any other patterns match
{: .info}

Every `if` statement follows this pattern, which makes it easy to program. Here's what the template for an "if" statement looks like:

{% highlight haskell %}
if {-conditional-} then {-run this expression-} else {-run this expression instead-}
{% endhighlight %}

**If statements** are expressions like any other, so we can use them wherever we can use any other expression. They're basically a fork in the road. Only one expression gets evaluated depending on the answer to the *yes / no* question. We ask a question, and if the answer is "yes", the computer runs the `then` expression and the `else` expression is completely skipped. If the answer to the question is "no", it runs the `else` expression instead.

The expressions after "then" and "else" can be *any* expression, like the ones we've been writing. But the *yes / no* question is a special kind of expression called a **conditional**.

A **conditional** can only ever result in one of two values: *yes* or *no*. Or, in programming-speak, a conditional gives back a **boolean**.

### Booleans

A **boolean** is a word for a variable that can have one of two values. In English, "yes" and "no" are booleans. So are "true" and "false" - there are only two options. It doesn't really matter what words we call the two choices, the point is that booleans can only be one of two things at a certain point in time.

In Elm, there's a type for booleans called `Bool`. A value that's a Bool type can only be one of two things:

  1. `True`
  2. `False`

They are both capitalized because they're actually **type constructors**, not just normal variables. Type constructors sound scary, but they're actually very simple - they're expressions that **create a value of a certain type**. We've already built lots of types, we just didn't know we were using type constructors.

Quotes build a String type value, so they're String type constructors:
{% highlight haskell %}
"sup"
{% endhighlight %}

Parentheses are used as Tuple type constructors, because they take in values and make a Tuple out of them.
{% highlight haskell %}
(1, 2)
{% endhighlight %}

Just like typing out "Hello" creates a String type, typing out True with a capital T creates a Bool type.

Note the difference:

{% highlight haskell %}
true -- I'm a regular old variable
True -- I'm a special *type constructor* for the Bool type
{% endhighlight %}

**Constructor** is used all over in programming. I'm not sure why they decided on a word that sounds so formal, but all it means is an expression that **creates something**.

### Comparison Operators

So how do we make a conditional expression that outputs a boolean value? There are several functions built into Elm called **comparison** functions which take two inputs, compares them, and outputs a boolean.

Here are a few of our options for comparison functions:

  1. `>`, which is read as "greater than"
  2. `<`, which is read as "less than"
  3. `==`, which is read as "the same as"
  4. `/=`, which is read as "not the same as"

These functions are a little different from the ones we've seen so far. With most functions, we put all the inputs *after* the function name when we call them.

{% highlight haskell %}
add 1 2 -- gives back 3 when evaluated
{% endhighlight %}

With comparison functions, we put the function in between the inputs. This makes things look a little more natural when we read them in our code.

{% highlight haskell %}
2.5 > 10         -- False
1 < 2            -- True
'a' < 'b'        -- True
1 == 2           -- False
"Hello" /= "Hey" -- True
{% endhighlight %}

### An example `if` expression

Don't type this out, just follow along and try to understand the idea. Imagine we're writing a function that outputs one of two sentences depending on whether the color of the sky is blue or not. This is a perfect place for an `if` expression because we can make this into a yes/no question. We can ask "Is the sky blue?"

If the answer is yes, we want to give back the sentence "It's daytime!"

If the answer is no, we want to give back the sentence "Maybe it's nighttime?"

So we have the three things we need for the `if` expression:

  1. a yes / no question: "Is the sky blue?"
  2. an expression for if the answer is yes: "It's daytime!"
  3. an expression for if the answer is no: "Maybe it's nighttime?"

We need to write a function that checks whether the color of the sky is blue or not. We can't put spaces or question marks in function names, so we'll call it `isTheSkyBlue`.

Fortunately, this is a completely contrived example that I'm making up as we go, so we have a Sky module we can import which has a function `color` that gives the current color of the sky.

We could write `isTheSkyBlue` like this:

{% highlight haskell %}
istheSkyBlue color = color == "blue"
{% endhighlight %}

This can be read as,

theSkyIsBlue is a function that takes a color and checks whether the color is the same as the String "blue"
{: .info}

This function definition will give back `True` or `False`, so we can use the function in an `if` expression, which would look something like this.

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html
import Sky

theSkyIsBlue color = color == "blue"

main = if (theSkyIsBlue Sky.color)
       then Html.text "It's daytime!"
       else Html.text "Maybe it's nighttime?"
{% endhighlight %}

As with other expressions, spacing doesn't matter. So we could have written the `if` expression in one line.

Here's the flow of what's happening in the code.

![if-then-else](images/if-then-else-sky.png)

Remember, only *one* of the expressions will be evaluated.
{: .info }

So if the conditional expression evaluates to True, the `else` condition won't do anything, even if it would do something *terrible* if it were to run.

### Adding conditional expressions to `update`

Enough examples - let's add the messages to the `update` function.

{% highlight haskell %}
update message model =
  if message == "asked for cats" then           -- TODO: handle the change
  else if message == "asked for dogs" then      -- TODO: handle the change
  else if message == "asked for ice cream" then -- TODO: handle the change
  else -- TODO: the message isn't something we recognize, so do nothing
{% endhighlight %}

Here's the flow diagram of what we're doing with this code. The computer reads the lines top down and only evaluates the `else` expressions if it has to.

![if-then-else-tree](images/if-then-else-tree.png)

Ok, now we just need to handle the changes.

### Making Changes

Here's what our model looks like again just so we know what we're working with.

{% highlight haskell %}
model = ("cats", "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif")
{% endhighlight %}

In our `update` function, we're going to react to the message and give back a *new model*. We're not actually changing the existing model, we're creating a new one. This shouldn't make intuitive sense yet because we haven't talked about what it means to "make" data, but the point is that Elm never overwrites values. When we make what looks like a change, it creates a new structure where the parts that didn't change are the same. This is kind of one of the defining features of Elm, and is what inspired frameworks like <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">Facebook's React</a>.

Admittedly, not being able to change anything in our program sounds like a terrible design decision. But 50 years of programming research has proven otherwise. Most of the bugs that occur in programs happen from variables unexpectedly changing. It causes problems that are difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot. Facebook's <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js" target="_blank">Immutable JS</a> was developed to allow for developing in this style, and has some more background on why not allowing data to change is a good thing.

### Actually handling change in our `update`

Our model is just a Tuple of two Strings. So each of the `if` conditions in our code need to give back a new Tuple with different Strings inside.

Find some pictures on <a href="http://www.giphy.com/" target="_blank">Giphy</a> and replace each of the "image" expressions below with a URL. Or, if you're lazy, you can use the URLs that I found.

{% highlight text %}
catPicture = "https://media.giphy.com/media/ND6xkVPaj8tHO/giphy.gif"
dogPicture = "https://media.giphy.com/media/oJWx7MtpR2qdi/giphy.gif"
iceCreamPicture = "https://media.giphy.com/media/QjagU0ONoQwCc/giphy.gif"
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight haskell %}
update message model =
       if message == "asked for cats" then ("cats", image)
  else if message == "asked for dogs" then ("dogs", image)
  else if message == "asked for ice cream" then ("ice cream", image)
  else model
{% endhighlight %}

In the last line, we're just giving back the old model if the message doesn't match one of the Strings we expect our message to be.

### Triggering changes

So now our `update` is ready to handle changes, but we don't have any way to trigger each of the different messages. We set up messages to trigger by telling components in the view what event to listen for, and what message to trigger when the event happens. The most common types of events are from user input, like mouse clicks or key presses. So our plan is to tell each of the buttons to listen for mouse clicks, and then trigger the correct message for the `update` to handle.

To listen for mouse clicks, we need to import the `Html.Events` module. This module has lots of different functions for handling events, all of which can be seen <a href="http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Events" target="_blank">in the documentation</a>.

{% highlight haskell %}
import Html.Events exposing (..)
{% endhighlight %}

We'll be using the `onClick` function, which takes one input, the message to trigger, and returns an Html Attribute. We'll add this attribute after the styling for each of the buttons.

{% highlight haskell %}
view model = div
  [ pageStyling ]
  [
    Html.h1 [ headingStyling ] [ Html.text (Tuple.first model) ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling, Html.Events.onClick "asked for cats" ] [ Html.text "cats" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling, Html.Events.onClick "asked for dogs" ] [ Html.text "dogs" ],
    Html.button [ buttonStyling, Html.Events.onClick "asked for ice cream" ] [ Html.text "ice cream" ],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.br [] [],
    Html.img [ imageStyling, Html.Attributes.src (Tuple.second model) ] []
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

Refresh the page and make sure each of the buttons work. Once they do, we can commit our changes.

{% highlight shell %}
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add update function and event handlers on buttons"
{% endhighlight %}

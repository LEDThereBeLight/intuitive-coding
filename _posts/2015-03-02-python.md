In programming, every language uses the same ideas, but has different ways of accomplishing the same things. It's important to be comfortable with several different languages, because different problems are easier to solve using different methods. The more languages you know, the more ways you can think about how to solve a particular problem.

We're going to switch to the Python language. Python is philosophically harder than Elm, because it doesn't separate functions from commands. Variables can be either functions *or* commands, so it's important to keep in mind whether you're making a function (a word that returns a value) or a command (a word that makes a change to an existing value, or has some effect).

But Python is a popular language with a much larger ecosystem built up around it, so we can take advantage of more code that other people have written to do more complicated things without having to write the code ourselves.

If you need to run Python code and don't want to get your computer set up to run it (which can be a pain), I recommend using [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python), an online compiler.
